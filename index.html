    <h3>BUSSINES</h3>
    <p>My first own business was opening a store on the marketplace.
      the profit was very small. about $1800/month before taxes. 
    this shop working now without me.</p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wildberries.ru/catalog/32718070/detail.aspx">My Shop on marketplace</a>
    <p>after opening the store, I bought game consoles and started renting them out. The business closed quickly, due to the theft of all consoles;)</p>
    <p>After that, I realized that I needed to open something big and decided to open my own tobacco shop. Already from the first days, the profit was good, and by the end it reached $ 340 per day. After working for 4 months, the store brought $ 10,000</p>

  <p>
    Next, I was offered a point in the tourist place Sviyazhsk Island. There I opened 2 points; One sold drinks and other souvenirs. It was the most profitable investment. In the period from June to August, points in total brought $ 45,000 per month</p>
